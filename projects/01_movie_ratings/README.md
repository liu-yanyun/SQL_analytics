# MovieLens SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the MovieLens dataset using SQLite to answer practical questions about movie popularity, user behaviour, and tagging activity.

## Dataset
This project uses the MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset provided by GroupLens.

- Source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
- Version: ml-latest-small
- Description: 100,000 ratings applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users.

MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset, containing movies, ratings, tags, and user interactions.

## Key Questions
Through SQL-based analysis, this project answers practical questions such as:
- Which movies are most popular or highly rated?
- How active are users in rating and tagging content?
- Are certain movies frequently rated together by the same users?

These types of analyses are commonly used to support recommendation systems, content discovery, and user engagement analysis in real-world applications.

SQL queries were written in SQLite using joins, subqueries, aggregations, and self-joins.

## Structure
- sql/: SQL scripts
- reports/: written analysis and interpretation
